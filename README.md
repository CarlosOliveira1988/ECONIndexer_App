# ECONIndexer_API
Repository used to store and manipulate some __Brazilian Economic Indexers__, such as __IPCA, CDI, SELIC__, etc.

The main purpose of this repository is improving my skills with __Python__ and __Streamlit__. Also, I am starting with __MongoDB__.

For now, we have 2 main apps:

- [user_app](https://econindexerapi-user.streamlit.app/): used to display a full table related to each Economic Indexer, in order to perform some calculation and analyse some charts

- [admin_app](https://econindexerapi-insert.streamlit.app/): used to register the Economic Indexers values in MongoDB (once a month, usually in the 15th day)
